# Getting Started
- Get the source - 
`git clone https://github.com/daytonellwanger/HermesMessageBusClients.git`

- [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

# Running individual clients

The clients can be manually run for debugging purposes. If you run into problems manually running them, then the message bus probably will too.
